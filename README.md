# Summarization of English-Yoruba Tweets with Code-Switches
The goal of this experiment is to summarize tweets with English and Yoruba code switches.

**Keywords:** Code-Switching, Tweet Summarization, Language Identification, Code-switching Detection, Translation, Natural Language Processing.

## The Data
The [twitter_data](https://github.com/gloryodeyemi/COMP_8730_Project/blob/main/Data/twitter_data.csv) csv file has three columns:
* **Tweets:** Tweets with code-switches collected from Twitter using the Twitter API with Twitter developer account credentials and a python library - [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/). 
* **Eng_source:** Human annotated English translation of the tweets. 
* **Summary:** Human annotated summary of the tweets.
